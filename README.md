### TFG

This is my final Electronic Engineering project. Since I discovered FPGA I always wanted to get deep with it but never had neither the resources and the time, so for my final project of my degree I decided to explore the capabilities of the FPGA PYNQ-Z2. 
I wanted to learn how to integrate an FPGA into a real project, connecting and controlling multiple peripherals such as motors, sensors, and LCDs. I also wanted to explore the potential that has been brought together by a processing unit system (PS) and a Programmable Logic system (PL). The PYNQ-Z2 development board is based on the Xilinx ZynqXC7Z020 System on Chip (SoC). The Arm processor it has is capable of developing embedded applications. I chose to use C for PS programming and VHDL for PL programming
