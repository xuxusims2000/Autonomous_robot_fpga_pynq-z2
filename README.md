### TFG

This is part of my final digree progect on Electronic Enginiering. Since I discovered FPGA i allwais wanted to get deep with it but never had nither the resourses and the time so for my final progect of my degree i decided to explore the capabilites of the FPGA PYNQ-Z2. 
I wanted to use learn to integrate an FPGA into a real progect conecting and controling multiple periferials as motors ,sensors and LCDs. I also wanted to explore the pontential that has convainig a Prosesing unit Sistem (PS) and a Programable Logic sistem (PL). The PYNQ-Z2 
development board is based on the Xillinx ZynqXC7Z020 System on Chim (SoC). It has a Arm procesor that can build embedded aplications. I decided to use C to program the PS and VHDL to program the PL
